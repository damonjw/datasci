    "Some degree of inequality might be acceptable if economic mobility were high, i.e. if everyone had similar chances of reaching either end of the wealth distribution. Economic mobility is often measured by splitting the population into five equal brackets (\"quintiles\"), and measuring the chance of moving between brackets. From [a report by the Brookings Institute](https://www.brookings.edu/research/economic-mobility-of-families-across-generations/),\n",

    "\n",
    "Let's measure economic mobility by recording the wealth distribution at one timepoint, and again some number of timesteps later, splitting the two distributions into quintiles, and counting what fraction of the population moved by more than one quintile from beginning to end. (In each timestep a median individual might find their wealth increasing or decreasing by around 50%, so one timestep corresponds roughly to several years of human life.) For example, if we have a population of 5000 and we draw up a matrix $A$ where $A_{i j}$ is the number of people who start in quintile $i$ and end up in quintile $j$, we might get\n",
